# APILEECH – Privacy

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your data.**

- All captured requests, history, and preferences stay on your device.
- Request data is held only in the extension’s memory (and in any export file you choose to save). It is not sent to our servers or to APILEECH developers.
- Stored data is limited to local Chrome storage for your settings (e.g. theme, shell format, “hide static resources”). We have no access to it.
- The extension does not include analytics, tracking, or telemetry.

For privacy-related questions, contact **dev@avenyx.io**.
